# MetaHuman
MetaHuman Creator has been decades in the making. Companies like 3Lateral and Cubic Motion have been pushing the limits of digital human creation for years. Now, as part of Epic Games, they've been able to push the technology even further—and make it happen in real time. Most importantly, they've made it accessible to everyone. 

# Feature
- `Easy and fun`
MetaHuman Creator is so easy to use, you may not even need to open the user guide! Simply select a starting point from the diverse range in the database, choose several more to contribute to your MetaHuman, and blend between them. Then, refine your character with sculpting tools and control guides, just by dragging on the asset.
- `Hugely variable`
With near-infinite variations of facial features and skin complexions, plus an array of different choices for hair, eyes, make-up, and teeth, you can create a huge variety of faces for your projects. Pick the body type you want for your character and dress them with different clothing sets in the tool—soon, you’ll have the perfect MetaHuman.
- `Physically plausible`
MetaHuman Creator derives its data from real-world scans and your adjustments are constrained to fit within the limits of the examples in its database, so it’s simple to make physically plausible MetaHumans. Other factors, such as the carefully selected range of skin tones and hair colors, also help ensure accuracy.
- `Real-time ready`
MetaHumans can run in real time on high-end PCs with RTX graphics cards, even at their highest quality with strand-based hair and ray tracing enabled. Assets come with eight LODs, some of which employ hair cards, enabling you to achieve real-time performance on everything from Android to XSX and PS5.
- `Rigged for animation`
MetaHumans come with a full facial and body rig, ready to animate in Unreal Engine, either keyed, or using a performance capture solution like our own Live Link Face iOS app. There's also support in the works from the vendors of ARKit, DI4D, Digital Domain, Dynamixyz, Faceware, JALI, Speech Graphics, and Cubic Motion solutions.
- `Source data included`
When you're happy with your MetaHuman, you can download it via the free Quixel Bridge application. You'll also get the source data in the form of an Autodesk Maya file, including meshes, skeleton, facial rig, animation controls, and materials, so you can further edit and refine your MetaHuman to your heart's content.
